	Linked List Implementation for a Queue:
Dynamic Size:
 Linked lists are a better choice when the size of the queue needs to be dynamic. Linked list nodes can be allocated or deallocated as needed, allowing for efficient resizing.
Frequent Enqueue and Dequeue Operations:
 Linked lists excel when there are frequent enqueue and dequeue operations, especially at both ends of the list. Enqueue and dequeue operations have O(1) time complexity at the front and back of the linked list.
No Fixed Capacity: 
If you don't know the maximum number of elements that will be in the queue in advance, a linked list is a good choice because it can grow dynamically without requiring a fixed capacity.
	Array Implementation for a Queue:
Fixed Size or Bounded Capacity:
 Arrays are suitable when you have a fixed-size queue, and the number of elements is limited to the array's capacity. This can be useful for scenarios where resource constraints are important.

	Random Access Requirements:
 If you need fast random access to elements in the queue (e.g., accessing elements by index), arrays are more efficient. In a linked list, you'd need to traverse the list to access an element by index, which takes O(n) time.
Memory Efficiency: Arrays are often more memory-efficient than linked lists because they don't incur the overhead of maintaining pointers for each element. In scenarios with limited memory resources, this can be an important consideration.
